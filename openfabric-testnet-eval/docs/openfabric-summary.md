Openfabric Documentation Summary
Openfabric is a decentralized AI infrastructure allowing developers to deploy, monetize, and interconnect AI agents in a blockchain-powered environment. Key aspects include:

Architecture: Built on a distributed OS (DOS) model that enables interoperability between AI services.

AI Agents: Reusable and composable agents built using defined ontologies.

Smart Contracts: For handling economy and governance on-chain.

$OFN Token: Native token for access, staking, and incentivization.

Tooling: Includes CLI, Python SDK, and graphical interface.

Testing Challenges:

Validating decentralized inference accuracy.

Testing asynchronous message delivery between AI nodes.

Verifying smart contract-triggered logic.

Handling UI+Wallet interactions under slow connections.
