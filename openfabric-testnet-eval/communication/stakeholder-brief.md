Stakeholder Update 7

Dear Stakeholder,

We encountered a temporary failure in our model inference layer. The issue was rooted in ontology misalignment between dependent AI agents. Our diagnostic model isolated the event to a failed handshake in the chaining mechanism. Resolution involved regenerating a compatible schema.

Impact: Partial service failure (<2%)
Resolution Time: ~4 hours
Preventive Measure: Unit test expansion & schema validator integration

Thanks for your attention,
